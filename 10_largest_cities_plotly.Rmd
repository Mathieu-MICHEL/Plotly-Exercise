```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(plotly)
library(xlsx)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data 

To complete the **Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly**.
I use a very small dataset of cities with their population, derived from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
data <- read.xlsx("Largest Cities.xlsx",1)
print(data)
```



## Plot

```{r plotly, echo = FALSE}
# data$city <- as.factor(data$city)
# levels(data$city) <- data[order(data$pop,decreasing = T),]$city
data$city <- factor(data$city, levels = data$city)

fig <- plot_ly(x = data$pop, 
               y = data$city, 
               type = 'bar', 
               orientation = 'h',
               marker = list(color = 'rgba(188, 0, 45, 1)'))
fig
```

## Thank you
